### Lecture 1

Importance (WHY)
---------------
	Data structures and algorithms are the two cores of programming today.
	Data structures are used to organize data, while algorithms are used to
	manipulate the same data. The behavior of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) in
	this course is a cut-down version of Standard Template Library (STL) in
	C++. One of the most important parts of programming is object-oriented
	programming. Other such parts include recursion, sorting and searching. We
	will lay the foundation for these.

Goals
-----
	To understand the data types inside out, not just have a basic idea of
	what the structures do. We also want to implement these structures as
	classes in C++. With this knowledge, we want to understand which data
	structures are appropriate in different scenarios. Finally, we want to be
	familiar with OOP and software development.
	
Phases of Software Development
------------------------------
	Basic Design Strategy has four primary steps. First, we must specify the
	problem, which consists of outlining the basic input/output (I/O). Next,
	we have to design data structures and algorithms (pseudo code) and then
	implement it in a language such as C++. Finally, when the code is
	complete, we have to test and debug the program manually. 

	Design technique mainly consists of decomposing the problem by splitting
	it up into small, doable steps that contribute to the overall goal. Two
	important issues are pre-conditions and post-conditions, and running time
	analysis. Time analysis is very important as it is indicative of the
	efficiency of software.

What are Preconditions and Postconditions?
------------------------------------------
	The precondition statement indicates what must be true before the function
	is called. It is very important to understand WHAT exactly is being
	processed/worked with before thinking about any details about the code.
	The postcondition statement indicates what must be true, or what the
	state must be, once the program completes its work. Here is an example:

	void write_sqrt(double x)
	// Precondition: x >= 0
	// Postcondition: The square root of x has been written to the
	// standard output.
	{
	// Code...
	}

	The precondition and postcondition are pretty much like the documentation
	of the program. They appear as comments in a program. They are usually
	placed after the function's parameter list. Violating the precondition might 
	even crash a computer. It is important to ensure that a function is called 
	with its proper preconditions and that it returns the proper postconditions.  

	void write_sqrt(double x)
	// Precondition: x >= 0
	// Postcondition: The square root of x has been written to the
	// standard output.
	{
		assert(x >= 0);
		// Code...
	}

Running Time Analysis - Big O
-----------------------------
	Time analysis is very important for an algorithm. It is often the case
	that a better order algorithm (in terms of time analysis) is more
	important than simply having a very fast processor. 

	There are three main types of orders: linear, quadratic and logarithmic.
	Out of these, the fastest and hence most efficient is logarithmic time.
	The notation for time analysis is O(n), where n is indicative of the time
	taken by a process.

	O can be determined by considering the number of processes carried out by
	a certain algorithm or procedure. Even a for loop has 2 processes before
	it actually carries out whatever is nestled within it. These processes
	are:
		1. Check whether i (the iterator) is less than the limit specified
		2. After completion of the procedure within the for loop, increment
		   the iterator by 1. 
	It also has an initial procedure of assigning the initial value to the
	iterator. So, at the very least a for loop has 2n+1 processes and is O(n).


	for(i = 0; i < strlen(str); i++) {
		c = str[i];
		cout << c;
	}

	This is an example of O(n^2) since in the for loop, another for loop is
	running. (strlen() is essentially a for loop that measures the length of a
	string of chars). To improve this we can do:

	n = strlen(str);
	for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		c = str[i];
		cout << c;
	} 

	This is now faster since it is O(n).
