### Polynomial Class with a Dynamic Array

A container class where the indexes represent the exponent of a coefficient.
For example, an array of **[1, 2, 1]** would represent a polynomial of **x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1**.
Instead of having a fixed capacity, the capacity dynamically increases as more coefficients are added.
