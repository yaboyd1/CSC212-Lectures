Running tests for polynomial class

START OF TEST 1:
Testing basic functions (25 points).
I will now test the default constructor. After initializing
with the default constructor, a the coefficient member
function should always return zero (even beyond MAX_EX).
Test passed.

I will now test the constructor with arguments.
Test passed.

I will now test constructor like this: polynomial p(0.0, 3).
After initializing this way, a polynomial
should have all zero coefficients (even beyond MAX_EX).
Test passed.

I will now test assign_coef.
Test passed.

I will now test add_to_coef.
Test passed.

Checking that add_to_coef correctly adjusts degree downward.
Test passed.

Checking that assign_coef correctly adjusts degree downward.
Test passed.

I will now test the clear function.
Test passed.

Inserting 30 random coefficients
   and then checking the basic functions.
Test passed.

Test 1 got 25 points out of a possible 25.
END OF TEST 1.


START OF TEST 2:
Testing derivative function (5 points).
Testing derivative.
Test passed.

Test 2 got 5 points out of a possible 5.
END OF TEST 2.


START OF TEST 3:
Testing eval and operator ( ) (5 points).
Testing eval and operator ( ).
Test 3 got 5 points out of a possible 5.
END OF TEST 3.


START OF TEST 4:
Testing next_term and previous_term function (5 points).
Testing next_term function.
Next Term Function is okay.
Testing previous_term function.
Testing previous_term(0)
Test 4 got 5 points out of a possible 5.
END OF TEST 4.


START OF TEST 5:
Testing operator + (5 points).
Testing operator +
Test passed.

Test 5 got 5 points out of a possible 5.
END OF TEST 5.


START OF TEST 6:
Testing operator - (5 points).
Testing operator -
Test passed.

Test 6 got 5 points out of a possible 5.
END OF TEST 6.


START OF TEST 7:
Testing operator * (5 points).
Testing operator *
Test passed.

Test 7 got 5 points out of a possible 5.
END OF TEST 7.


START OF TEST 8:
Testing operator << (5 points).
Printing a polynomial for visual inspection by the TA: 
-5.5x^5 + 3.3x^3 - 2.2x^2 + 1.1x + 10
Test 8 got 5 points out of a possible 5.
END OF TEST 8.

If you submit this to Dora now, you will have
60 points out of the 60 points from this test program.
