Bag
---
	A bag is an data structure that allows for the containment of numbers
	regardless of number of occurences and the order in which they are
	inserted.

	The properties of bags include
		1. Beginning with an 'initial' state where the bag is empty
		2. The ability to insert numbers without any restrictions such as
		   re-occurrence, etc.
		3. The ability to erase a number from the bag.
		4. The ability to count how many numbers are contained inside the bag.

	Bags can be implemented using C++ classes and can give be given class
	properties, methods, etc. 

Static Variables
----------------
	Static variables are those that are used *universally* among every
	instance of a class. Essentially, if we create 5 bags, then for example,
	static const size_t CAPACITY would indicate that CAPACITY is used for
	every object of class bag. Not every bag will have a copy of CAPACITY.
	There will only be one memory address for CAPACITY, and each object
	references it. 

	This disallows us to have bags with different capacities, however. This is
	the reason why these types of bags are known as *static bags*.
