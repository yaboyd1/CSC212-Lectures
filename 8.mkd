Time Analysis of the Bag Class
------------------------------
	count - the number of occurrences
		This is O(n) because we are conducting a for loop across
		the bag to see how many members are of a given type.
	erase_one - remove one from the bag
		This is also O(n), though it can be O(1) at best, if the item to be
		removed is the first one in the bag. Otherwise, if it is the last
		(worst case) then we would have to conduct a for loop to find and
		remove it. 
	erase - remove all
		This is O(n). In its best case it does n processes, as erase does not
		stop at the first occurrence of an item. In its worst case it deletes
		every item (if all items in the bag are the same, and are the ones
		asked to be deleted by the user). 
	insert - put one item at the end
		This is also O(n), though in most cases it is a constant O(1). It can
		be linear in its worst case, it the size of the dynamic array is
		exhausted. In this case, a new array has to be constructed, with a for
		loop being used to copy over values from the first array.
